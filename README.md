# Multi_Omics
Data for analysis of Multi-Omics Interaction model. Y~ M + ePRS*adversity + covariates

For this project we are analyzing a Multi-Omics Interaction model to predict childhood problems. 
The variables in the model are: 
 - ePRS -> expression based polygenic risk score 
 - M -> methylation score 
 - adversity -> prenatal or postnatal adversity score 
 - covariates -> PC buccal cells or PC blood cell types + PC population
